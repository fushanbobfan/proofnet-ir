# Trust model

## Trusted

- the Lean 4 kernel selected by `lean-toolchain`;
- the compiled definitions and theorems in this repository, after `lake build`;
- the small object-logic derivation type used for supported reconstruction.
- the `CutFreeDerivation` rule syntax only after its occurrence positions and
  explicit exchange have passed `build?`;
- the proof carried by `desequentializeChecked?` that the resulting
  certificate passed the reference checker.

## Untrusted

- an AI model or graph neural network proposing certificates;
- prompts, retrieved text, local-model summaries, and imported papers;
- a future Python/TypeScript dataset generator or visualizer;
- the Python focused-search baseline and dataset regeneration wrapper;
- external JSON and the parsing path; callers should use
  `Certificate.checkedFromString`, whose return value includes the revalidated
  Lean checker acceptance proof;
- generated or external unindexed LeanProp schemas; callers must pass them
  through `LeanProp.Schema.Raw.Derivation.elaborate?` before treating them as
  typed derivations; `infer?` alone exposes only the formula boundary;
- LeanProp schema JSON and its parser; callers should use
  `LeanProp.Schema.Raw.Derivation.checkedFromString`, whose result retains a
  successful indexed elaboration and exposes `CheckedDerivation.sound`;
- benchmark labels not regenerated from checked certificates;
- the high-level claim that proof geometry improves proof search.

## Current theorem boundary

`Certificate.check_sound_declarative` states that executable acceptance
implies:

1. the Boolean-free `StructurallyWellFormed` proposition, including local link
   legality and exact occurrence ownership;
2. every graph satisfying the independent inductive `ChoiceSelection`
   switching relation satisfies `Graph.IsTree`.

`wellFormed_iff_structurallyWellFormed` proves that the executable structural
pass is sound and complete for independent proposition-level definitions of
link, node, conclusion, and resource-use discipline. Formula Boolean equality
is supplied by `DecidableEq`, so Lean also has its `LawfulBEq` proof.

`mem_switchingGraphs_iff` proves that the executable enumeration contains
exactly those independently described switchings, closing the risk that an
enumerator bug could silently omit a par choice from the semantic contract.

`Graph.IsTree` is a proposition over bounded edges, an independent inductive
`Graph.Walk` from vertex zero to every in-bounds vertex, and the edge-count
equation. `reachable_sound` proves that membership in the finite closure really
produces such a walk; the proof proceeds through closure preservation and does
not define a walk to mean "the algorithm returned true."

`WalkN` is a second independent relation indexed by its exact number of edge
steps. `closureN_walkWithin` and `walkN_mem_closureN` prove that finite closure
at depth `fuel` is equivalent to the existence of a path of at most `fuel`
steps, provided stored edges are in bounds. `isTree_iff_fuelTree` and
`check_iff_fuelDeclarativelyCorrect` lifts both independent relations to the
complete certificate checker.

`Walk.toSimple` now erases loops from every arbitrary `Graph.Walk`.
`SimpleWalk.toWalkWithin` uses duplicate-free vertex counting to bound the
result by `vertexCount` when stored edges are bounded. Consequently
`connected_iff_connected`, `isTree_iff_isTree`, `check_iff_correct`, and
`check_iff_declarativelyCorrect` identify the executable checker with the
original unbounded public semantics. None of these results is the proof-net
sequentialization theorem.

An independent differential audit additionally compares the compiled checker
against a Python union-find/certificate oracle on every simple graph through
six vertices and 1,000 generated or mutated certificates. See
`docs/audit-v0.1.0.md`; this is regression evidence, not part of the trusted
kernel proof.

The supported reconstruction boundary is broader than a fixed fixture but
still explicit: `Derivation.identity` and `identityCertificate` cover the
recursive family `A, A-dual`, and `reconstructIdentity?` requires exact
certificate equality. It does not treat checker acceptance alone as permission
to return a preselected derivation.

v0.2 added the derivation-first direction for arbitrary first-order cut-free
trees: validated desequentialization constructs a candidate certificate and
gates the checked API on `Certificate.check = true`. The post-v0.5
`infer?_eq_some_iff_build?_conclusions` theorem proves that formula validation
and occurrence-aware construction succeed together. The subsequent
`desequentialize?_conclusionFormulas?` theorem proves that every successfully
constructed public certificate reads back exactly the inferred ordered
boundary. The composition proofs now additionally establish structural
well-formedness and every-switching tree correctness for every successful
build; `build?_check` and `desequentialize?_check` derive executable checker
acceptance rather than assuming it. The checked gate remains explicit in the
runtime API, while `desequentializeChecked?_exists_of_infer?` and
`elaborate?_exists_of_infer?` prove it cannot fail after successful `infer?`.
Release v0.4.0
also proves the reverse direction for the supported representation:
`sequentialization_of_check` maps every accepted certificate to a concrete
first-order tree whose executable output is `ProofNetEquivalent` to the
input. The theorem preserves the ordered formula boundary and does not identify
arbitrary unlabeled graphs. The v0.5 runtime path is independently tied to
that guarantee: `sequentialize_complete` proves that the public finite search
returns a proof-bearing result on every checker-accepted certificate.

For LeanProp wire inputs, `inferAt_eq_elaborateAt` kernel-proves that the
formula-only raw checker and typed elaborator agree on acceptance, rejection,
error category, detail, and child path. `elaborate?_complete` proves every raw
checker acceptance has an indexed witness with the same boundary. The public
wire checker runs the elaborator directly, and `CheckedDerivation.sound`
forwards the resulting indexed term to `Schema.PackedDerivation.sound`. The
trust audit records the exact dependencies: the agreement/completeness
theorems and `CheckedDerivation.inferred` use `[propext, Quot.sound]`; the
permutation-boundary agreement and checked soundness theorem use `[propext]`.
At the typed context layer, permutation completeness and the two exchange-
admissibility theorems are axiom-free; the two dependent-environment inverse
laws use `[propext]`.

Canonical v0.2 serialization trusts the formula-array numbering as occurrence
identity. Sorting links/conclusions and orienting axiom endpoints is a stable
wire-format rule, not a graph-isomorphism theorem. Dataset labels are emitted
by Lean and cross-checked by the independent Python oracle; the committed
dataset itself remains untrusted input when consumed by later experiments.

The separate v0.3 `reindex-v1` path first relabels vertices by their ordered
first occurrence in conclusions and links. Lean proves this value unchanged by
every bounded `VertexRenaming`. For structurally well-formed inputs, Lean also
proves traversal coverage, constructs the induced renaming, proves the normal
form is in the original class, and proves normal-form equality iff
`ReindexEquivalent`. The generic parser validates the declared algorithm and
normalized payload; logical acceptance is still rechecked separately.

For checker-accepted values, the supported production pairwise identity API is
`CheckedCertificate.sameProofNet?`. Lean proves its Boolean result is true iff
the two certificates satisfy exactly `ProofNetEquivalent`: bounded vertex
renaming followed by link-list permutation, preserving ordered conclusions,
connective premises, formula labels, and axiom orientation. The optimized
candidate generator enforces the ordered boundary during enumeration, and its
completeness feeds the already-audited exact decision theorem. This is neither
an arbitrary graph-isomorphism oracle nor a canonical serialization theorem.

## Failure containment

Even if a future graph proposer, optimized checker, or sequentializer is wrong,
the final Lean proof must still elaborate and pass the kernel. Experimental
metrics must distinguish:

- syntactically valid JSON;
- structurally well-formed certificates;
- switching-valid certificates;
- sequentialization success;
- Lean kernel success.

Collapsing these stages into a single "solved" label would hide the project's
most useful diagnostic signal.
