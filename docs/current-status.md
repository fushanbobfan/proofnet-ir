# Current status

> **Replacement policy:** this page contains one rolling mathematics
> checkpoint. Update it in place; do not append checkpoint history here.

This page is the replaceable status record for the rolling research branch.
It is updated in place when a new mathematics checkpoint supersedes the
previous one.
Historical checkpoints belong in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md), proof design
belongs in [v0.10-design.md](v0.10-design.md), and stable release guarantees
belong in the corresponding release audit.

Documentation-only commits may descend from the proof checkpoint without
changing its mathematical authority. The stable release and rolling branch
make different claims. A downstream consumer that needs reproducibility should
pin `v0.9.0`. The `main` branch is the integration surface for ongoing Figure-7
scheduler and completeness work.

## Stable v0.9.0 result

For the documented unit-free, cut-free MLL certificate model, v0.9.0 provides:

- occurrence-aware graph semantics, including parallel stored-edge identity;
- an executable Boolean checker proved equivalent to independent structural
  and switching-tree correctness;
- checked desequentialization from cut-free derivations;
- complete checker-free sequentialization for every accepted certificate;
- ordered-conclusion `ProofNetEquivalent` canonical identity and stable wire
  formats;
- sound eager and worklist unification fast paths whose exact wrappers retain
  the complete recursive sequentializer as fallback;
- generated API documentation, checked consumers, compatibility contracts,
  property/fuzz/differential/performance gates, and release-pinned consumption.

The exact release guarantees, receipts, and non-goals are frozen in the
[v0.9.0 release audit](v0.9-release-audit.md).

## Rolling main result

The current checkpoint normalizes the exact parent escape forced when a
Nop/Wait non-global ready-tail witness is absent. The preceding reduction
still produces `ActiveCarrierParentEscape`: a distinct concretely marked
non-global active-frontier premise whose submitted connective parent leaves
the active occurrence carrier. Given canonical tag history, declarative
correctness, the scheduler invariant, exact occurrence accounting, that
escape, and the no-tail condition, the new theorem splits on its submitted
source and returns `ActiveCarrierParentTemporalResidual`.

For a par source, the concrete mark is authenticated by a reservation anchor
inside the active carrier. Its parent continuation is then either a raw
sibling equal to the selected head or outside the carrier, strictly older
queued work, or a strictly older marked conclusion. For a tensor source, the
escaped mark's representative is exactly the active raw boundary, while the
tensor sibling and parent conclusion are outside the carrier; the existing
full-history older-marked-tensor invariant is retained without inventing the
strict trigger it would need. The normalization does not eliminate either
residual, produce a ready-tail witness, or assume or derive
`ActiveTopDebtTailLaw`.

The preceding queue/history-tail checkpoint remains valid. For supplied typed
Nop and Wait steps, its iff theorems identify post-step debt with the exact
non-global `remainingTop` witness, assuming the input scheduler invariant and
prior debt. Its reset-aware `CanonicalTagHistory.ActiveTopDebtTailLaw` still
packages all six branch obligations, and its endpoint theorem still derives
debt only from a supplied instance of that law. Correctness plus canonical
history has not yet been proved to produce the law.

The earlier Wait obstruction also remains valid: every successful typed Wait
from a scheduler-invariant input refutes unrestricted
`ActiveTopContinuationExitLocalized` at its output. It rules out that unchanged
same-component locality carrier, but neither refutes direct debt nor supplies
the required queue-tail or parent re-entry argument.

The checkpoint's new public surface is exactly six declaration boundaries:

```text
ProofNetIR.SequentialFigure7.ActiveRawMarkReservationAnchor
ProofNetIR.SequentialFigure7.ActiveParParentContinuation
ProofNetIR.SequentialFigure7.ActiveParCarrierTemporalResidual
ProofNetIR.SequentialFigure7.CanonicalTagHistory.ActiveCarrierTensorSameBoundaryResidual
ProofNetIR.SequentialFigure7.ActiveCarrierParentTemporalResidual
ProofNetIR.SequentialFigure7.ActiveCarrierParentEscape.temporalResidual_of_no_readyTail
```

The earlier debt, history-tail, continuation-exit, and conditional all-marked
results remain valid. The new reduction exposes a narrower obstruction; it
does not make any conditional implication unconditional.

### Finite ready-head boundary audit

A separately committed bounded replay now classifies each visited state after
successful initialization as marking-incomplete or fully marked and checks
exact typed ready-head reconstruction before invoking the dispatcher. In the
default replay, all 22,590 incomplete states had a ready head and a successful
dispatch, while all 594 dispatch-none stops were fully marked. The extended
replay classified 95,190 incomplete states and 1,254 fully marked stops in the
same way. The cross-variant replay classified 1,172,208 incomplete states and
10,608 fully marked stops.

Across all three modes, the incomplete-without-head,
incomplete-dispatch-none, cycle, and truncation counters were zero. Any future
violation produces a replayable certificate, state, event history, and rule
trace rather than only an aggregate count. These results are bounded
falsification evidence, not a proof of semantic nonterminal-to-ready-head
coverage or progress. Exact counters and scope are maintained in
[performance.md](performance.md).

Exact signatures are maintained in the generated API reference for the
[active-top marked-nonconclusion debt](api-reference.md#active-top-marked-nonconclusion-debt),
[active-top debt branch residuals](api-reference.md#active-top-debt-branch-residuals),
[active-top debt ready-tail normalization](api-reference.md#active-top-debt-ready-tail-normalization),
[active-top debt history-tail law](api-reference.md#active-top-debt-history-tail-law),
[active-top debt parent escape](api-reference.md#active-top-debt-parent-escape),
[parent-escape temporal residual](api-reference.md#active-top-debt-parent-escape-temporal-residual),
[branch-local continuation credit](api-reference.md#branch-local-continuation-credit),
[continuation-credit preservation](api-reference.md#continuation-credit-preservation),
[endpoint-localized continuation exits](api-reference.md#endpoint-localized-continuation-exits),
and the retained
[Wait endpoint-locality obstruction](api-reference.md#wait-endpoint-locality-obstruction).
The first open proof step is now failure-conditioned and source-specific:
eliminate the par continuation residual or turn it into a distinct active
ready-tail payer, and prove the corresponding tensor re-entry or
distinct-payment law despite its same-boundary mark. The remaining
global-created Forward/UnifyPayload alternatives must also be derived.
Together these are the missing implication from correctness plus canonical
tag history to `ActiveTopDebtTailLaw`. Only after that law is established can
the debt and drained reductions contribute to an unconditional progress or
completion argument.

## What the rolling theorem does not prove

This checkpoint does not establish any of the following:

- construction or existence of a relevant `ExecutedHistory`, reachable state,
  `CanonicalTagHistory`, `ReadyHeadInput`, or successful Nop or Wait transition;
- impossibility of `ActiveCarrierParentEscape`, exclusivity between an escape
  and a valid non-global ready-tail witness, or a proof that an escaped parent
  re-enters the active carrier;
- elimination of `ActiveCarrierParentTemporalResidual`, including the
  par continuation and tensor same-boundary external-sibling cases;
- the failure-conditioned par/tensor re-entry or ordered distinct-payment law
  needed to turn the normalized escape into the missing queue-tail result;
- derivation of `ActiveTopDebtTailLaw` from declarative correctness,
  reachability, or the matching canonical tag history;
- existence of the exact non-global `remainingTop` witness for Nop or Wait, or
  the exact global-created tail alternative for Forward or UnifyPayload, from
  supplied correctness and history;
- endpoint debt from canonical history alone, without the explicit tail-law
  premise;
- that any reachable canonical history contains a Wait, or that the output of a
  supplied Wait is active-top drained;
- necessity of `ActiveTopContinuationExitLocalized`, or its derivation from
  declarative correctness, reachability, or supplied canonical history;
- preservation of another Wait-compatible drained, temporal, or
  cross-component locality law;
- an unconditional reachable-state proof that `ActiveTopDrained` implies
  `core.allMarked = true`, semantic completion, or terminality without a
  compatible sufficient completion premise;
- an exclusivity theorem for the exact-dispatch / active-top-drained
  disjunction;
- a proof that every relevant semantic nonterminal state presents a ready head;
- unconditional elimination of `ReadyHeadMarkedTensorPredecessorGap` without
  the invariant and complete scheduler hypotheses;
- global preservation of the mate-region or older-raw-mark invariant families;
- the remaining global created-candidate raw seams or queue-origin laws needed
  by those separate invariant families;
- exhaustive enabledness of the canonical dispatcher;
- dispatcher progress or later-state totality;
- pure-worklist completeness;
- removal of the complete recursive fallback;
- faithful whole-program `NEXTAXIOM`/token-age scheduling; or
- a Guerrini-style whole-program linear bound.

These are research gates, not undocumented assumptions. Their current proof
plan is maintained in [v0.10-design.md](v0.10-design.md) and
[roadmap.md](roadmap.md).

## Current library-readiness position

The stable v0.9.0 surface is independently consumable for its exact model.
The rolling branch retains and continuously checks:

- one public umbrella import, `import ProofNetIR`;
- a generated declaration reference;
- source and tag-pinned downstream consumers;
- compatibility and migration contracts for public wire formats;
- checked parsing of untrusted certificate and LeanProp data;
- deterministic unit, property, fuzz, differential, reconstruction, and
  performance gates;
- exact trust-boundary and no-placeholder audits;
- preregistered experiment artifacts and publication-boundary checks.

This does not make the project a mature broad proof-net library. The supported
logic remains unit-free, cut-free MLL; there is no claim for units, Mix, cuts
or cut elimination, additives, exponentials, quantifiers, a general Lean
tactic, arbitrary graph-isomorphism canonicalization, external adoption, or
independent research validation.

## Empirical status

The committed deterministic matched experiment uses 1,000 generated tasks and
an equal 1,000-unit method budget:

| Method | Solved |
| --- | ---: |
| Focused sequent search | 760/1000 |
| Formula-skeleton proof-net generation | 1000/1000 |
| One-edit checker-guided repair | 1000/1000 |

The methods receive deliberately different structural help, consume zero model
tokens, and do not establish a general proof-net advantage.

The amended 180-task model study reports:

| Method | Solved |
| --- | ---: |
| Focused search | 85/180 |
| Net generation | 160/180 |
| Constructed distance-ordered repair | 180/180 |
| Model direct | 117/180 |
| Model repair | 2/180 |

The exact protocols, frozen artifacts, timing amendments, costs, failure modes,
and limitations live under `experiments/` and in
[experiment-protocol.md](experiment-protocol.md). These finite studies are
not ordinary Lean theorem-proving benchmarks and are not evidence of external
deployment.

## Open macro gates

The project goal remains open. The principal outstanding gates are:

1. eliminate the failure-conditioned par continuation and tensor same-boundary
   temporal residuals by a re-entry or ordered distinct-payment law, and
   derive the remaining global-created Forward/UnifyPayload alternatives;
   equivalently, prove that correctness plus `CanonicalTagHistory` implies
   `ActiveTopDebtTailLaw`. Only after that gate may endpoint debt combine with
   active-top drainedness and marking incompleteness in an unconditional
   progress argument. The unrestricted `ActiveTopContinuationExitLocalized`
   law remains refuted after every supplied successful typed Wait from a
   scheduler-invariant input, so it cannot replace the tail law. Reachable Wait
   existence, post-Wait drainedness, unconditional `allMarked`, progress,
   completion, terminality, later-state totality, and arbitrary history
   existence remain open;
2. close the separate queue-origin and remaining created-candidate laws needed
   by the global mate-region and raw-mark preservation families;
3. derive exhaustive nonterminal dispatcher progress and later-state totality;
4. prove pure-worklist completeness and remove the recursive fallback without
   weakening the accepted-certificate theorem;
5. implement and verify faithful `NEXTAXIOM`/token-age scheduling and its
   whole-program complexity;
6. continue the traceable, page/chapter-level literature matrix without
   treating file discovery or structural scans as completed reading;
7. preserve public API, migration, downstream, experiment, and release gates
   as the mathematical surface grows.
