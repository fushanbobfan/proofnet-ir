# Roadmap

## v0.1 - Verified MLL reference core

- [x] Pin Lean 4 toolchain.
- [x] Define unit-free MLL formulas and involutive negation.
- [x] Define formula occurrences and axiom/tensor/par links.
- [x] Check local structural invariants.
- [x] Enumerate all switchings.
- [x] Prove switching enumeration sound and complete against an independent
  one-edge-per-par inductive relation.
- [x] Implement the reference tree checker.
- [x] Prove semantic soundness against an independent inductive walk relation.
- [x] Prove completeness/iff for the exact finite-computation contract.
- [x] Reconstruct one supported canonical sequent derivation.
- [x] Add at least 20 compile-time positive/negative assertions.
- [x] Add a versioned JSON Schema and fixtures.
- [x] Prove finite closure membership implies an inductive graph walk.
- [x] Prove a bounded inductive walk is found after some finite closure depth.
- [x] Prove `closureN fuel` iff an independent path of at most `fuel` steps
  exists, and lift the iff through `isTree` and `Certificate.check`.
- [x] Prove every arbitrary in-bounds graph walk reduces to a path within the
  `vertexCount` budget, identifying `Correct` and `FuelCorrect`.
- [ ] Prove general sequentialization for the supported representation.
- [x] Add a second generated proof-tree/net family and labeled mutation tests.
- [x] Generalize derivation-first generation and gated reconstruction to the
  recursive identity family `A, A-dual` at arbitrary formula depth.
- [x] Audit the v0.1.0 checker against an independent oracle on all 33,868
  simple graphs through six vertices and 1,000 generated/mutated certificates.
- [x] Replace the Boolean premise in declarative structural correctness with
  an independent proposition and prove the executable/specification iff.
- [x] Generalize generation/desequentialization from identity nets to arbitrary
  cut-free derivation trees.
- [x] Define lossless bounded vertex renaming, formula/link/conclusion
  transport, and a kernel-checked inverse round trip.
- [x] Prove structural, switching, and checker/declarative correctness
  invariant under arbitrary bounded vertex renaming.
- [x] Define `ReindexEquivalent`, prove it is an equivalence relation, and
  prove it preserves executable and declarative correctness.
- [ ] Compute a stable serialization representative for each supported
  reindexing-equivalence class and add migration/property tests.

## v0.2 - Dataset and repair loop

- [x] Specify a controlled comparison against focused cut-free proof search.
- [x] Generate valid derivation trees first, then desequentialize to proof nets.
- [x] Produce dataset mutations for missing links, duplicated resources, and
  self-axioms; retain regression fixtures for non-dual axioms, cycles,
  disconnection, and wrong connective attachment.
- [x] Canonicalize v0.2 certificate serialization under the documented fixed
  occurrence-numbering contract.
- [x] Publish 1,000 checker-labeled records with a deterministic generator,
  independent-oracle verification, and a content hash.
- [x] Implement a runnable focused cut-free search baseline.
- [ ] Define graph edit operations and compare direct sequent generation,
  graph generation, and graph repair in a model-backed experiment.
- [ ] Report validity, repair success, Lean calls, token cost, and redundancy
  collapse without claiming theorem-proving gains before measurement.

## v0.3 - Persistent LeanProp bridge

- Add a two-context design for persistent and linear hypotheses.
- Make weakening and contraction explicit.
- Support conjunction, implication, equality rewriting, universal
  instantiation, and existential witness nodes.
- Reconstruct Lean proof terms for a generated template corpus.

## Later research

- certified contraction/linear-time correctness checking;
- cut links and cut elimination as graph rewriting;
- additives, exponentials/boxes, and unification nets;
- hierarchical proof graphs for dependency-rich mathlib theorems;
- a `proofnet_ai` tactic that treats all model output as untrusted input.

The success criterion is empirical and kernel-checked. A visually appealing
graph or a lower token count without matched proof success is not enough.
